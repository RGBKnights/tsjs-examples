This was set up to tech colleagues about TensorFlow.js 

SLTM - This example of Short Long Term network to predict if there is a series of 4 numbers (0 or 1) in a row in a sequence of 10 numbers. Although this is a very simple example. It does illustrate 2 points:
1. How to use SLTM layer in TS. 
2. How changes in training size related to the number of epochs needed to reach a min. validation accuracy.
